"Subject: Exclusive Insights on Ocrevus vs Kesimpta and Our Mitigation Strategies

Dear Healthcare Professional,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to share some valuable insights from our recent market research on the comparison between Ocrevus and Kesimpta, and how we are addressing the challenges to ensure the best possible outcomes for our patients.

The research indicates that the primary reason patients switch from Ocrevus to Kesimpta is the preference for at-home administration, as both drugs are perceived to have equal efficacy and safety profiles. Other reasons for switching include avoiding steroids, experiencing the 'crap gap' on Ocrevus, side effects, or disease progression. The 'crap gap' or 'crap week' is mentioned by some MS patients on both drugs, although it is not always acknowledged by HCPs, which can be frustrating for patients.

Here are some patient quotes that highlight their experiences:

1. ""I switched from Ocrevus to Kesimpta for convenience... Each injection is of no consequence. I just do it and go about my life.""
2. ""I am all in for Kesimpta and no crap gaps.""

Considering these insights, we have developed strategies to mitigate the risks and improve patient satisfaction:

1. Emphasize the importance of patient-centric care and address individual patient needs and preferences when selecting a treatment option.
2. Educate patients and HCPs about the 'crap gap' phenomenon and provide guidance on managing associated symptoms.
3. Address concerns regarding infusion capacity and travel challenges for rural patients by exploring alternative administration options and local infusion centers.
4. Collaborate with payers and insurance providers to ensure smooth access to both Ocrevus and Kesimpta, addressing any potential insurance issues.
5. Continue to promote Ocrevus's benefits, including its proven efficacy and safety profile, while acknowledging the convenience of Kesimpta's at-home administration.

Additionally, I would like to address some internal insights:

1. Novartis's claims regarding Kesimpta's safety for patients trying to conceive and cost-effectiveness will be countered with data on Ocrevus's long-term safety and value.
2. We are working on improving infusion capacity and patient education to ensure a seamless Ocrevus treatment experience.
3. Doctors concerned about safety or side effects with Ocrevus will be provided with updated safety data and guidance on patient selection.
4. Patient preference and disease severity will continue to guide our treatment recommendations, ensuring the best possible outcomes for each individual.

Thank you for your time and attention. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,

"Medical Newsletter - Latest Updates on Crovalimab for PNH Treatment

Dear Healthcare Professionals and Doctors,

We are excited to share the latest developments on Genentech's Crovalimab, an innovative treatment option for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). Our focus is on providing you with essential information about the drug's unique features, efficacy, and safety profile, as well as its potential benefits for your patients.

What is Crovalimab?
Crovalimab is an investigational, novel anti-C5 recycling monoclonal antibody designed to block the complement system, a crucial part of the innate immune system that acts as the body's first line of defense against infection. Engineered to address the medical needs of people living with PNH, Crovalimab has been developed to offer a convenient subcutaneous (SC) administration option, empowering patients to take control of their treatment journey.

Product Positioning Strategy
Our product positioning strategy centers on targeting treatment-naive and experienced C5i-eligible PNH patients who value treatment autonomy and convenience. We proudly present Piasky as a next-generation SC C5i, offering a distinct advantage over traditional treatments. By reducing patient burden through simple q4w SC injections, either administered at home or in a clinical setting, Piasky provides an unparalleled level of flexibility and freedom for individuals manage their condition effectively.

The Rationale Behind Our Positioning
Our positioning strategy is grounded in the belief that patients deserve access to a treatment that not only matches the proven efficacy and safety of the trusted C5i Standard of Care (SoC) but also introduces a novel dose interval-extending recycling mechanism. By doing so, we aim to provide an emotional benefit that allows patients to regain control over their lives, free from the constraints of frequent hospital visits and invasive procedures.

Latest Developments & Efficacy Results
Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted Genentech's Biologics License Application (BLA) for Crovalimab, following positive results from the pivotal Phase III COMMODORE 2 study. This trial demonstrated that Crovalimab achieved non-inferiority compared to the SoC in reducing the annualized rate of hemolysis events, while offering the advantages of subcutaneous self-administration.

Additionally, data from the COMMODORE 1 and 2 studies will be submitted to regulatory authorities worldwide, further solidifying the strong evidence supporting Crovalimab's safety and efficacy profile.

Potential Benefits for Patients
By choosing Piasky, patients can experience several benefits that improve their quality of life and empower them to take charge of their PNH management:
        Convenience: Simple q4w SC injections allow patients to administer their medication at home or in a clinical setting, eliminating the need for frequent hospital visits.
        Flexibility: With the option for subcutaneous self-administration, patients can tailor their treatment schedule to their individual needs and lifestyle.
        Effectiveness: Crovalimab has shown non-inferiority compared to the SoC in reducing the annualized rate of hemolysis events, ensuring that patients receive robust protection against PNH symptoms.
        Emotional Relief: By regaining control over their treatment journey, patients can experience a significant reduction in stress and anxiety associated with managing their condition.

Conclusion
At Genentech, we remain committed to advancing the standard of care for PNH patients. With Crovalimab, we aim to revolutionize the way this rare disease is treated, placing the power back into the hands of those affected. We believe that our innovative approach will significantly impact the lives of treatment-naive and experienced C5i-eligible PNH patients, granting them greater autonomy, convenience, and peace of mind.

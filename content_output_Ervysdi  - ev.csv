"Subject: Evrysdi: Addressing Safety Concerns and Insights from Recent Market Research

Dear Healthcare Professionals,

I hope this message finds you well. As the Global Communication Expert for the Brand Team Evrysdi, I am reaching out to share valuable insights from our latest market research and address the safety concerns that have been brought to our attention.

Understanding Evrysdi’s Impact
Evrysdi (risdiplam) has been a beacon of hope for many families affected by Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Our commitment to improving the lives of patients is unwavering, and we continuously strive to enhance our understanding of Evrysdi’s impact through rigorous research and open dialogue with healthcare providers like you.

Market Research Insights
Our recent market research has provided us with two critical insights:
Neurological Safety When Switching from Spinraza to Evrysdi: We understand the concerns regarding potential neuro damage when transitioning from Spinraza to Evrysdi. It is important to note that Evrysdi and Spinraza target the SMN2 gene differently, and comparative studies suggest that Evrysdi may offer improved outcomes for certain types of SMA (1,2,3). However, as the therapies have not been directly compared in clinical trials, we advise caution and recommend discussing individual patient cases with a specialist.
Safety Concerns Related to Pregnancy and Long-Term Effects: Given that Evrysdi is a relatively new treatment, questions about its long-term effects and safety during pregnancy are understandable. We have established a pregnancy exposure registry to monitor outcomes and encourage healthcare providers to register patients (4). Additionally, we are committed to conducting long-term studies to provide more comprehensive data (5).

Addressing Safety Concerns
We take safety concerns seriously and have implemented several measures to ensure the well-being of patients:
Continuous Monitoring: Our surveillance program meticulously tracks and analyzes all reported adverse events, ensuring prompt action when necessary.
Educational Resources: We provide extensive educational materials to healthcare professionals to aid in the safe administration of Evrysdi and to inform about potential side effects.
Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies: We work closely with regulatory authorities worldwide to update safety profiles and guidelines based on the latest evidence.

Commitment to Transparency
Transparency is at the core of our operations. We pledge to keep you informed about any new findings that may affect the administration of Evrysdi. Our goal is to empower you with the information necessary to make the best decisions for your patients.

Looking Ahead
The journey to a world without SMA is a collaborative effort. We value your partnership and are grateful for the trust you place in our products and research. Together, we can continue to make strides in the treatment of SMA and improve patient outcomes.

Your Role
Your feedback is crucial to our progress. We encourage you to share your experiences with Evrysdi, as your insights are instrumental in shaping our research and development efforts.

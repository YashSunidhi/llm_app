"Subject: Embracing Innovation and Safety in MS Treatment - Insights on Ocrevus

Dear Healthcare Professionals,

I hope this message finds you well. As the Global Communication Expert for the Ocrevus Brand Team, I am reaching out to share valuable insights from our latest market research and address the evolving landscape of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment, particularly concerning Ocrevus and Kesimpta.

Understanding the Choices: Ocrevus vs. Kesimpta

Our recent market analysis has revealed a competitive environment where Kesimpta is being promoted based on its breastfeeding safety, convenience, and lower cost compared to Ocrevus12. However, it is crucial to delve deeper into these claims to understand the full picture and make informed decisions for patient care.

Breastfeeding Safety and Ocrevus

The topic of breastfeeding while on MS treatment is of paramount importance. Ocrevus, with its established safety profile, has been a subject of discussion among healthcare providers (HCPs). While most neurologists recommend pausing Ocrevus during pregnancy, new evidence suggests that it is safe to continue through pregnancy, at least until the second trimester3. For breastfeeding mothers, Ocrevus is considered safe, with the recommendation to refrain from nursing for the initial 24-48 hours post-infusion3. This cautious approach aligns with our commitment to patient safety and well-being.

Addressing the Convenience Factor

The convenience of home administration is a significant factor in the choice between Ocrevus and Kesimpta. We acknowledge that some patients have expressed a preference for Kesimpta’s at-home administration4. However, it is essential to consider the broader implications of treatment administration, including the support and monitoring provided during infusions, which can be critical for patient safety and comfort.

Cost Considerations

When it comes to cost, Ocrevus presents a compelling value proposition. The annual cost of therapy for Ocrevus is approximately $65,000, compared to Kesimpta’s $83,000 in the US5. This difference is noteworthy, especially when considering the long-term financial impact on healthcare systems and patients.

Efficacy and Safety: A Balanced View

Both Ocrevus and Kesimpta are seen as having equal efficacy and safety profiles1. Ocrevus has demonstrated a reduction in the annualized relapse rate by 47% versus interferon beta-1a in RMS patients1. It is also approved for both relapsing and primary progressive forms of MS, offering a comprehensive treatment option for a broader patient population.

Our Commitment to Patient-Centered Care

At the heart of our mission is the commitment to patient-centered care. We strive to provide treatments that not only address the clinical aspects of MS but also consider the patient’s lifestyle, preferences, and overall well-being. Our team is dedicated to supporting HCPs with accurate information, resources, and ongoing dialogue to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients.

Conclusion

In conclusion, while Kesimpta may offer certain advantages in terms of administration convenience, Ocrevus stands strong with a proven safety profile, cost-effectiveness, and comprehensive indications for MS treatment. We are here to support you in navigating these options and ensuring that your patients receive the care that aligns with their needs and circumstances.

Thank you for your continued dedication to improving the lives of those affected by MS. We look forward to collaborating with you to advance the standards of care in this field.

Warm regards,

[Your Name] Global Communication Expert, Ocrevus Brand Team

Subject: Phesgo: a convenient and effective option for HER2-positive breast cancer

Dear HCP,

We are writing to share some important information about Phesgo, a fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab with hyaluronidase, administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in combination with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, for the treatment of early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. [1](^1^)

We understand that you may have some concerns about the cost and safety of Phesgo compared to the standard IV administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab. We would like to address these issues and provide you with some evidence to support the use of Phesgo in your clinical practice.

Cost-effectiveness of Phesgo

Phesgo offers a convenient and faster administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in a single SC injection given in minutes, compared to hours with IV infusion. This can reduce the burden on patients, caregivers, and healthcare resources, and improve the quality of life and satisfaction of patients. [1](^1^)

Phesgo is also cost-effective compared to IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab, as it can save time and resources associated with IV infusion, such as drug preparation, infusion pumps, infusion sets, and observation time. A systematic review of studies comparing SC and IV administration of oncology biologics in a hospital setting found that SC administration costs were lower for consumables, drug wastage, use of central venous access devices, overheads, nursing and pharmacy supplies, and avoiding catheter implantation surgeries. [2](^10^)

Moreover, Phesgo is covered by most major insurance plans, and there are financial assistance options available for eligible patients who cannot afford their medication. [1](^1^)

Safety and efficacy of Phesgo

Phesgo has been shown to be non-inferior to IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab in terms of efficacy and safety in clinical trials. The Phase 3 FeDeriCa study demonstrated that Phesgo achieved comparable levels of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the blood (pharmacokinetics) and similar rates of pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer. The safety profile of Phesgo was consistent with that of IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab, with no new or unexpected safety signals. [3](^2^)

Phesgo has a fixed SC dose of 1200 mg/600 mg, regardless of body weight, whereas IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab are dosed based on body weight. You may wonder if this affects the exposure and outcomes of patients with different body weights. A scoping review of studies comparing SC and IV trastuzumab found that body weight is not an important determinant of exposure to trastuzumab at steady state, and that there is no evidence that low-body-weight patients are at increased risk of cardiotoxicity with SC trastuzumab. [4](^5^)

Furthermore, a modeling and simulation analysis compared the exposure, pharmacodynamic effect, and safety of Phesgo and IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab in patients with different body weights. The results showed that the exposure and average concentration of Phesgo were similar to those of IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab, whereas the peak concentration was lower with Phesgo. The reduction in amyloid PET SUVr, a measure of pharmacodynamic effect, was also similar between Phesgo and IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab. The risk of ARIA-E, a measure of safety, was slightly lower with Phesgo than with IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab. [5](^9^)

These findings suggest that Phesgo provides comparable efficacy and safety to IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab, regardless of body weight, and that a fixed SC dose is appropriate for Phesgo.

We hope that this email has addressed your concerns and provided you with some useful information about Phesgo. We believe that Phesgo is a convenient and effective option for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, and that it can improve the quality of care and outcomes for this patient population.

If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact us. We would be happy to discuss Phesgo with you further and provide you with more resources and support.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

Pharma communication expert

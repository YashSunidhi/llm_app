ocrevus,"Insight 1: “Kesimpta being promoted based on breastfeeding safety, convenience and lower cost vs Ocrevus”
Insight 2: 
”There seems to be different opinions of HCPs when it comes to the use of Ocrevus before and during pregnancy. Most neurologists recommend stopping Ocrevus during pregnancy  which is also supported by the general expectation that patients are ‘protected’ during pregnancy. 
Some HCPs discussed new evidence showing that Ocrevus is safe to continue through pregnancy, at least until the second trimester and not to have it during the last trimester .  
Overall Ocrevus is safe for use during breastfeeding, largely based on doctors' recommendations. However, the breastfeeding mother should refrain from nursing for the initial 24-48 hours after infusion. Also 2  patients talked about the new data of Ocrevus being safe during breastfeeding. 
There were 3 instances where patients switched  from Ocrevus to Kesimpta while breastfeeding because of the convenient home administration.
The main reason for switching from Ocrevus to Kesimpta is the preference for at-home administration, since the 2 drugs are seen as having equal efficacy and safety profile.""”
